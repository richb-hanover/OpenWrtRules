# Proposed OpenWrt Rules - June 2025

_[Compare to the current [OpenWrt Rules](https://openwrt.org/rules)]_

_**Membership**_

* The roles within the OpenWrt project are:
  active members, inactive members, and non-members.
  There is no core developer group or any other
  group of specially privileged members.
* Members may voluntarily switch between active and inactive status at any time.
* If a member appears not to be participating in project matters, 
  any active member may request that the non-participating
  member switch to inactive status. 
  This request must be sent by email to the person concerned,
  with the openwrt-adm mailing list in CC.
  If the person either agrees or does not respond within 30 days,
  they will be moved to inactive status.
  
_**Commit access**_

* Active members have commit access to all repositories.
  Inactive members and non-members do not.
* The commit credentials of inactive members are revoked.
  They will be restored upon their return to active status.
  
_**Voting**_

* All active members have the right to vote and are invited
  to liberally exercise this voting right in order to
  keep a broad consensus on project matters.
* For a simple approval, the proposal must achieve a two-thirds majority
  among the active members who participate in the vote.
  Additionally, it must receive approval from at least one-third
  of all active members,
  regardless of whether they participated in the vote.
* For a change to these rules, a 75% majority among the active members
  who participate in the vote must approve,
  as well as 50% approval from all active members.
* To propose changes to project matters or the overall development direction,
  a formal proposal must be sent to the openwrt-adm mailing list.
  The proposal must clearly describe the suggested changes
  and include a specific deadline for when the voting period will end.
  A simple approval is required.
* Frequent contributors may become members after a simple approval.
  Project members are free to suggest suitable candidates.
* Any votes and decisions made will be made public on the project website.

_**Infrastructure**_

* Project infrastructure should be outsourced to FOSS community operated services
  whenever possible in order to allow members
  to focus on actual development efforts.
* Any infrastructure that is operated by the project
  itself shall be administered by at least three different people
  to reduce the likelihood of the project getting locked out
  due to administrators being unreachable.
* Responsible administrators for the various services shall be documented publicly.

_**Other rules**_

* The project will not offer inidividual email accounts
  under its project domain for privacy and equality reasons.
* Be nice to each other (Formerly known as "Rule 12")
